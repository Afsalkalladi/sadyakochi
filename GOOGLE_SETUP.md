### File Structure Check

Your project should look like this:
```
eeonam/
â”œâ”€â”€ service-account.json          # Google credentials
â”œâ”€â”€ .env                         # Environment variables
â”œâ”€â”€ manage.py
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

### Environment Variables Check

Your `.env` should contain:
```env
GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON=./service-account.json
GOOGLE_SHEET_ID=1ABC...XYZ
GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID=1DEF...UVW
```
